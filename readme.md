# What I Learned

* SQL queries for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)
* Using NPM mysql module to interact with a MySQL backend
* Using sub SQL. I noticed it rquires asyn multiple queries so maybe I should have used promise mysql instead of repearting my sql queries.
* Creating SQL schema and seed files

# Usage

1. Use the CLI interface to select employee management options
2. Menu options lead to additional prompts
3. Options return to the home menu.
4. Select the next option as needed.
5. Use the Exit option to close the application.
